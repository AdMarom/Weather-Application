# Module 6 Weather Application API 

## Description 
A website where a user can search a city and get the current and future weather forecast using the open weather map api
This includes temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a weather icon. Their search will also be saved as a button so that they can search the same city again without typing it in the search bar.

## Table of Contents

## Installation
